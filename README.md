# food-data

Market analysis of delivery restaurants in Melbourne, using scraped data collected from DoorDash.

The first data analysis allows us to identify which food concepts or cuisines have the most opportunities for growth, with a concept named opportunity gap, that means, trying to find those cuisines that have greater demand than the current offer.

The second analysis focuses on the burger category to describe market share, pricing, and menus.
